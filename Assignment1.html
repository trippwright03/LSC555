The Marine and Family Virtual Library
</h1>

<h2 style="color:red;">
Context
</h2>

<h4>
The Marine and Family Virtual library is part of the greater Department of Defense Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Libraries which transformed to combine resources and efforts of the five branches of service (Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force) to deliver the highest value of online library services to DoD Service members and families.
</h4>
<h4>
Because the internet is a popular and powerful tool for information access, education, and entertainment, the DoD joint service initiative is streamlining how MWR provides online access to library services and eResources - members can now search for new library materials and upcoming programs at their local installation library; learn a new language; find a tutor; check out digital and audio books; these are just a few of the services to be offered in the new one-stop library shop.
</h4>

Unique and Interesting Features
</h2>

<h4>
The Marine and Family Virtual Library has a number of interesting features.  Most of these are geared specifically towards active-duty military members and their families.  The site features a professional reading list that recommends certain new books that are applicable to being a military professional that I found interesting.</h4>
<h4>
  Also, since many of its users are deployed overseas, the MFVL provides 24/7 access to over 40 online resources including eBooks, audiobooks, magazines, language learning, test prep and more, as well as paperback book kits to local patrons.

Pros and Cons/ Recommendations
</h2>

<h4>
The Marine and Family Virtual Library seems to have a great deal of online and physical resources for active-duty service members and their families, but one con is that only this particular group has access to all the goods.</h4>
<h4>
  Also, there is not much to explain where certain resources or requirements are when you go to the main website.  I would like to see more simple and easy to follow directions once one is on the actual main page of the website.
